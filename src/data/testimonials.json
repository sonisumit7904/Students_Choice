It tells us about different shops nearby that give student discounts, so they automatically become my top choice for eating out. Plus, it even takes you straight to Google Maps, so finding the place is super easy. Definitely saves both money and time!",

And the direct link to Google Maps is a lifesaver for finding new places quickly. Helps save a bit of money and makes things convenient!",
